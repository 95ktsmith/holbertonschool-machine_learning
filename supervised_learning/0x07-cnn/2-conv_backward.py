    Performs back propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network
    dZ is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h_new, w_new, c_new) containing the
        partial derivatives with respect to the unactivated output of the
        convolutional layer
        m is the number of examples
        h_new is the height of the output
        w_new is the width of the output
        c_new is the number of channels in the output
    A_prev is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h_prev, w_prev, c_prev) containing
        the output of the previous layer
        h_prev is the height of the previous layer
        w_prev is the width of the previous layer
        c_prev is the number of channels in the previous layer
    W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kh, kw, c_prev, c_new) containing the
        kernels for the convolution
        kh is the filter height
        kw is the filter width
    b is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, 1, 1, c_new) containing the biases
        applied to the convolution
    padding is a string that is either same or valid, indicating the type of
        padding used
    stride is a tuple of (sh, sw) containing the strides for the convolution
        sh is the stride for the height
        sw is the stride for the width
    Returns: The partial derivatives with respect to the previous layer, the
