    Trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent
    network is the model to train
    data is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, nx) containing the input data
    labels is a one-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (m, classes) containing the
        labels of data
    batch_size is the size of the batch used for mini-batch gradient descent
    epochs is the number of passes through data for mini-batch gradient descent
    verbose is a boolean that determines if output should be printed during
        training
    shuffle is a boolean that determines whether to shuffle the batches every
        epoch. Normally, it is a good idea to shuffle, but for reproducibility,
        we have chosen to set the default to False.
    validation_data is the data to validate the model with, if not None
    learning_rate_decay is a boolean that indicates whether learning rate decay
        should be used
        learning rate decay should only be performed if validation_data exists
        the decay should be performed using inverse time decay
        the learning rate should decay in a stepwise fashion after each epoch
        each time the learning rate updates, Keras should print a message
    alpha is the initial learning rate
    decay_rate is the decay rate
    save_best is a boolean indicating whether to save the model after each
        epoch if it is the best
        a model is considered the best if its validation loss is the lowest
            that the model has obtained
    filepath is the file path where the model should be saved
    Returns: the History object generated after training the model
